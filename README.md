Weaver is main + Alexa backed 
Cv controller does everything needing opencv
Heartbeatcontorller is bonus fun thing 
Chat handles robot to robot comms
April is functions and constants for swarming

Feel free to take weaver, 
and look at how to integrate other
Scripts as processes and threads.

For every get call task_done once or join will fail to sync
